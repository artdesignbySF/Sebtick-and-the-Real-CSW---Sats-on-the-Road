Title "Sats on the Road" by @countinbitcoin: https://twitter.com/countinbitcoin  


===========Lyrics===========
When I'm done on my way home
Walking slowly all on my own
Folks don't mind as they go on
While I've got miles left to go

Opendime is all that I own
Sold my life for sats on down low
Today is dark steady she go
The future's bright Satoshi he know

Those in the know they don't show
They walk along silent but strong
We ain't done fighting this woe
The citadels glowing gates gold
===========End Lyrics===========
